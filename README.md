# Weather-App
Software Requirements Specification (SRS)
**Introduction**

**1.1Purpose**
The purpose of this document is to outline the requirements for the development of a Weather
Web Desktop Application. This application will provide users with the ability to search for
weather details, including humidity, cloud information, and other relevant weather data.

**1.2 Scope**
The Weather Web Desktop Application will be a user-friendly platform accessible through web
browsers on desktop devices. It will utilize weather data APIs to retrieve and display weather
information for specified locations.
# 2. Functional Requirements
## 2.1 Search Functionality
Users can search for weather details of a specific location.
Acceptance Criteria:
- Users can input the name of a city or geographic location into the search bar.
- The application should display the weather details for the searched location, including
temperature, humidity, cloud coverage, and other relevant information.
- The search results should be accurate and up-to-date.

## 2.2 Weather Details Display
Display comprehensive weather details for the searched location.
Acceptance Criteria:
Show current temperature, wind speed, atmospheric pressure, and weather conditions (e.g.,
sunny, cloudy, rainy) for the specified location.
Provide a forecast for the upcoming days, including high and low temperatures, precipitation
chances, and wind direction.

## 2.3 Humidity Information
Provide humidity-related information.
Acceptance Criteria:
- Display the current humidity level for the searched location.
- Show historical humidity data if available.

## 2.4 Cloud Information
Display information related to cloud coverage.
Acceptance Criteria:
- Show the current cloud coverage percentage for the specified location.
- Offer insights into cloud patterns and changes over time if possible.
# 3 . Non-Functional Requirements

## 3.1 Performance
- The application should load quickly and efficiently even with a high volume of user requests.
- Response time for weather data retrieval should be within a reasonable timeframe (e.g., under
5 seconds).

## 3.2 User Interface
- The user interface should be intuitive and easy to navigate.
- Ensure compatibility with different web browsers and desktop screen sizes.

## 3.3 Reliability
- The application should be reliable, providing accurate and consistent weather information.
# 4 . Constraints
- The application will rely on external weather APIs for data, and its functionality might be
affected by the availability and reliability of these APIs.
- Compliance with third-party API usage limitations and guidelines.
